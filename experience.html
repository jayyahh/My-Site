            As a Full-Stack Software Engineer at Inspection Express, I am
            helping to develop a property management platform using Angular and
            C#, boosting operational efficiency for our clients by 80%. Our key
            features include digital agreement management, property inspections,
            report generation, and 360-degree virtual tours. I integrated OpenAI
            APIs for automatic photo comments, reducing manual workload by 50%.
            I implemented a multi-inspection scheduling feature with Apple Maps
            integration and built a route-finding algorithm, streamling the
            inspection planning process for our users. And I improved the
            multi-inspection scheduling's performance by 95% using AWS Simple
            Queue Service for task offloading. I also developed an email
            scheduling workflow with AWS Step Functions and Simple Email Service
            for seamless future integration within the application.

            During my time at Line Pay, I orchestrated the architecture and
            built the frontend application for financial services including
            loans, insurance, and donations within the Line Pay ecosystem using
            Next.js. I prioritized modular components and hooks for enhanced
            reusability, integrating tools like Redux, React Query, Axios, and
            more. Additionally, I developed an internal application utilizing
            Line Frontend Framework to provide clear visualization of data from
            Line's extensive APIs, both internal and external. This application
            significantly accelerated the development process for Line Pay's
            teams by streamlining data presentation.

              During my time at EA, I developed a spreadsheet editor tool within
              the Frostbite game engine using C#, XAML, and Visual Studio. This
              tool enables simultaneous editing of multiple in-game assets while
              facilitating value comparison in a spreadsheet format.
              Additionally, I designed an internal application using C# and .NET
              Core to automate the creation of C# solution filter files. These
              files contained essential project paths necessary for compiling
              and executing code based on its references, enhancing efficiency
              in development processes by reducing code compilation time by over
              90%.

            During my time at Mojio, I oversaw the maintenance and development
            of REST APIs as part of the backend platform team, utilizing Visual
            Studio and C#. I crafted two internal applications: one for
            visualizing and analyzing API calls received by our servers, and
            another for simulating the transmission of Mojio's device messages
            directly to Azure for testing purposes. Additionally, I spearheaded
            the design and implementation of the vehicle service schedule APIs
            within the Mojio product.

            My first technical role was a VR game engineer intern with Archiact
            in Vancouver, Canada. Collaborating with senior game designers and
            other software engineers, I was responsible for designing and
            implementing the prototype of a space survival VR game for Oculus Go
            using Unity and C#.
