					<div class="eaIntro">
						At EA, I built a spreadsheet editor tool in the Frostbite game engine using C#, XAML, and visual
						studio.
						It allows users to edit multiple in-game assets at once while comparing their values
						in a
						spreadsheet view.
						In addition, I also built an internal application with C# and .NET Core to generate C# solution
						filter file containing the necessary project paths to
						compile and run a piece of code based on its references.

					During my time at Mojio, I was responsible for maintaining and implementing REST APIs on the backend
					platform team using Visual Studio and C#.
					I created two internal applications: one was to visualize API calls our server received for analysis
					purposes, the other was to simulate sending Mojio's device messages to Azure directly for testing
					purposes.
					I also designed and implemented the vehicle service schedule APIs of the Mojio product.
