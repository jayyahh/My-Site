					I am currently working as a software engineer intern on the Frostbite team with Electronics Arts.
					Aside from updating the codebase with new controllers and view models in an MVVM fashion, I am also working on a project to design and implement a spreadsheet editor that allows users to select and edit multiple in-game assets in comparison using C#, XAML, and visual studio.

					During my time at Mojio, I was responsible for maintaining and implementing REST APIs on the backend platform team using Visual Studio and C#.
					I created two internal applications: one was to visualize API calls our server received for analysis purposes, the other was to simulate sending Mojio's device messages to Azure directly for testing purposes.
					I also designed and implemented the vehicle service schedule APIs of the Mojio product.
