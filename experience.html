            At Inspection Express, I help build a property management software
            with a focus on helping property managers save time and improve
            efficiency. Our product includes functionalities such as paperless
            office drafting and signing experience, property inspections, report
            generations, and 360 degree virtual tours. I focus on building the
            frontend with Angular and TypeScript and building the server with C#
            with .NET MVC pattern. My daily work includes coordinating with the
            head of product to design optimal user experience for our clients,
            coding independently to deliver new features, and collaborating with
            other team members on architectural programming design.

            At Line Pay, I designed the architecture and implemented the
            frontend application of the financial services that includes loans,
            insurance, and donation services inside the Line Pay application
            using Next.js. I modularized components and hooks for reusability
            and incorporated tools such as Redux, React Query, Axios and more.
            In addition, I created an internal application that uses Line
            Frontend Framework to enable a clear display of the data returned by
            all of Line's APIs, external and internal. This application was used
            by Line Pay's development team to speed up development process
            through precise data visualization.

              At EA, I built a spreadsheet editor tool in the Frostbite game
              engine using C#, XAML, and visual studio. It allows users to edit
              multiple in-game assets at once while comparing their values in a
              spreadsheet view. In addition, I also built an internal
              application with C# and .NET Core to generate C# solution filter
              file containing the necessary project paths to compile and run a
              piece of code based on its references.

            During my time at Mojio, I was responsible for maintaining and
            implementing REST APIs on the backend platform team using Visual
            Studio and C#. I created two internal applications: one was to
            visualize API calls our server received for analysis purposes, the
            other was to simulate sending Mojio's device messages to Azure
            directly for testing purposes. I also designed and implemented the
            vehicle service schedule APIs of the Mojio product.

            My first technical role was a VR game engineer intern with Archiact
            in Vancouver, Canada. Collaborating with senior game designers and
            other software engineers, I was responsible for designing and
            implementing the prototype of a space survival VR game for Oculus Go
            using Unity and C#.
